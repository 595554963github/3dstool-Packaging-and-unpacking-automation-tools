# 3dstool-Packaging-and-unpacking-automation-tools
3dstool、unpack、pack
This is the packaging and unpacking script I created for 3dstool, and compiled it into an exe using nuitka in Python 3.12. If you don't know how to use Python, then use my compiled exe to unpack and package the ROM of 3ds games. Even if you are a novice, you can easily get started with it, with a one click and foolproof unpacking and packaging.
You can directly solve the roms in 3ds or cci format. In fact, the roms in 3ds and cci format are identical. You can directly modify the suffix, and then unpack the roms. First, it will read the first 256 bytes of the roms, and change all the contents in front of the NCSD to FF, so that the solved roms can be repackaged into 3ds.You don't need any 3ds cracking tools at all, just a conversion tool that can convert CIA to CCI or 3ds is enough。Whether it's packaging the resources in a folder as ROM or unpacking ROM, it's very easy。
